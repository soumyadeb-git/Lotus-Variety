It is also used in cosmetics for its soothing properties. The Sacred Lotus typically blooms in the summer and is commonly found in shallow ponds, lakes, and water gardens.",

      "description": "While taxonomically a water lily and not a lotus, the Victoria Amazonica is often grouped with lotuses due to its massive size and aquatic nature. It produces the largest water lily leaves in the world, which can reach up to 3 meters (10 feet) in diameter and support the weight of a small child. The flowers are white on the first night they open and turn pink on the second night. It is native to the shallow waters of the Amazon River basin.",
